                    <p id="schoenbrunn_rally_starhemberg">On Sunday, 14 May 1933, the Austrian Home Guard holds a "Turks Deliverance Celebration" in Schlosspark Schönbrunn. Members of the fascist paramilitary organization arrive on special trains from all over the country, setting out in the early morning from the stations to the baroque royal palace and grouping in the grounds by 9 a.m. Participant numbers vary, depending on the political standpoint of the source, between 20,000 and 40,000. <sup>[1]</sup> Once the federal government representatives arrive, a Catholic mass is read in the open air. The speeches commemorating the liberation from the Second Turkish Siege of Vienna in 1683 begin at 10:20 a.m. and are broadcast live by Radio Wien until 11:05. <sup>[2]</sup> Following an aerial parade of Home Guard planes, the troops march via Schlossallee, Mariahilferstraße, Babenbergerstraße and Ringstraße to Schwarzenbergplatz, where the first battalions arrive at around 1:30 p.m.</p>

                    <p>The idea for the rally originated from the Home Guard chief Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, who suggested holding a military review for propaganda purposes to federal chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß and secured financial support from Benito Mussolini, Italy's fascist prime minister. <sup>[3]</sup> After Adolf Hitler had taken over as German chancellor at the end of January 1933, the Austrian cabinet used the resignation of the presidents of the national assembly in early March to adopt an authoritarian course of its own. The cabinet prevented parliamentary work and governed by emergency decree. Although the anniversary of the city's liberation from the Second Turkish Siege of Vienna was not until autumn, the aim was to give a public signal of Austria as a sovereign German nation earlier in the year:</p>

                    <p id="schoenbrunn_rally_map">The Austrian Home Guard's Turks Deliverance Celebration has the purpose of reminding the comrades, but also other broad sections of the population, of the fact of world history that Christianity, German customs and culture, and thus also the then German Reich were rescued from eastern barbarism 250 years ago on Austrian soil. <sup>[4]</sup></p>

                    <p>For this purpose, the government not only gave permission to use the former Habsburg summer residence as the location – the 17th-century Schönbrunn Palace – but also granted exceptions to the ban on marches on 12 May 1933. For "particular patriotic events promoting the state", the official communication stated, security minister Emil Fey could permit political rallies as an exception, in consultation with the federal chancellor. <sup>[5]</sup></p>
                    
                    <p>The latter two politicians even appear as speakers at the "Turks Deliverance Celebration". In his speech, Fey recalls the genealogical line allegedly leading from the events of 1683 to Austria's current situation. <sup>[6]</sup> He refers to Graf Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg, the city commandant who had defended Vienna against the Turkish troops and whose descendant now hoped to play a significant role in the construction of the so-called corporative state. Starhemberg then addresses an appeal to Engelbert Dollfuß to put an end to the country's "dishonourable existence" and to protect the people from "party politics" and "class struggle": "Be that saviour and be convinced, all will go with you and all will be with you, if you set about saving Austria." <sup>[7]</sup> The federal chancellor, wearing the uniform of the Tyrol Imperial Infantry, then maintains that the government has achieved more in two months than the "parliamentary machinery" in the previous two years. He was not fighting people, he claims, but "false ideas", for after the end of the world war "the enemy [had] infiltrated the nation. Foreign spirit and foreign ideas," Dollfuß says, "have lodged themselves and brought evil upon us." The aim, he says, is to "eradicate the red flood […] in its innermost ideas" and also to stand proudly against the National Socialist agitation: "We intend to renew the spirit in our homeland under the symbol under which the Christian Occident was liberated from the Asians two hundred and fifty years ago, under the symbol of the simple Christian cross." <sup>[8]</sup></p>

                    <p id="fox-newsreel_schoenbrunn-rally">The bourgeois newspapers also emphasized the idea that it was European culture that was defended in the summer of 1683. For the Neue Freie Presse, the Turkish siege was a "world decision between western and eastern mankind", which had chosen Vienna as its arena. <sup>[9]</sup> In the magazine Das interessante Blatt, the then director of the state archive, Heinrich Kretschmayr, described how the city had proved itself as a "barbican of Christendom". With the battle of liberation of 12 September 1683, the Habsburg monarchy had become a "performer of an achievement restricted by neither state nor nation, a pan-European achievement". <sup>[10]</sup> At the "Turks Deliverance Celebration" of 14 May 1933, in contrast, the historical idea that the Occident was saved in Vienna served as motivation to maintain Austria as a sovereign nation. According to the Neues Wiener Tagblatt, in Schlosspark Schönbrunn "men true to the homeland" made an "avowal to the German-Austrian stock's continuing will to live and to the resolution to continue the German mission in the southeast of the national settlement territory as an independent state, governing itself according to its own inherent laws." <sup>[11]</sup></p>

                    <p id="map_second-siege_1683">Whether Austria ought to continue to exist as an independent country had been a controversial subject since the end of World War I. The position that the small remainder of the monarchy ought to join the German Reich was taken not only by the right wing, but also by Social Democrats, who only changed their opinion once the National Socialists had taken power in Germany. "Annexation to a free and peaceful Germany of the future remains our goal," the central party newspaper writes on Saturday, 13 May 1933. "We fight all efforts for Austria's annexation to the fascist and nationalist Germany of today, as a threat to the freedom of the Austrian people and to peace in Europe." <sup>[12]</sup> While the National Socialists in the Engelmann-Arena are calling for the two countries to merge, the Social Democrats encourage their supporters to attend the republican "freedom celebrations" taking place on Sunday morning in the Vienna municipal buildings – the Karl-Marx-Hof, for instance. The leaders of the Home Guard, in contrast, turn their attention less to the future than to a history, "which we call the heroic age of Austria. A nation that does not honour its past has no future", wrote Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg in the closing comments to the Instructions for the Turks Deliverance Memorial Ceremony on 14 May 1933 in Vienna. <sup>[13]</sup></p>

                            Movie clip from a report in Fox Tönende Wochenschau, which was incorporated into the 1933 newsreels produced by Vienna's police department. The sequence begins with a speech held by Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, the leader of the Austrian Home Guard, at the "Turks Deliverance Celebration" in Schlosspark Schönbrunn on 14 May 1933: "Front soldiers among you, who like me have had the honour of staking your lives against the enemy, I call upon you today to think back. / Be proud to be German Austrians, be proud to be Austrian protectors of the homeland. / To welcome our front comrade, Federal Chancellor Dollfuß, as comrades." Then Engelbert Dollfuß, the Austrian chancellor, says: "When you celebrate this day and this time today, it is not a usual historical commemoration. Foreign spirit and foreign ideas are in our people, have lodged themselves and brought evil upon us. In the fight for the homeland, in the fight for the bettering of our homeland, we close ranks firm and true." Media devices are everywhere: a man winding a movie camera; a photographer taking pictures; an operator adjusting a microphone. The song played at the end is Joseph Haydn's Kaiserlied (1796/97), which was not only employed as the anthem for the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, but also as the tune of the Deutschlandlied, the German national anthem.
