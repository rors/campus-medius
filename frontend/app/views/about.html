            <p>What is a media experience? This is the conceptual question behind Campus Medius. The mapping project explores mediality as an experiential field by focusing on twenty-four hours in a metropolis—a time-space one might describe as the chronotope of the modernist novel. Our exemplary case on the weekend of May 13 and 14, 1933, in Vienna is marked by so-called Turks Deliverance Celebrations, which were held by the paramilitary Home Guard and the Austrian National Socialists. This anticipated anniversary of the city's liberation from the Second Turkish Siege in September 1683 was oriented from the outset on processes of media communication: the rallies were prepared by the political press, partially broadcast live on Radio Wien, and captured in propaganda films. To create counter-publicity, the Social Democrats published programmatic editorials and organized "freedom celebrations" in the municipal tenements. While the Burgtheater presented the play Campo di Maggio, co-written by Benito Mussolini, several cinemas were screening Fritz Lang's sound feature Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse, a film banned in Germany. In other movie theaters, adherents of National Socialism viewed the documentary Deutschland erwacht, and a group of Communists showed Sergei Eistenstein's Battleship Potemkin and Turksib by Viktor Turin. Moreover, the weekend edition of the Neue Freie Presse, Vienna's most important bourgeois newspaper, printed an essay titled "Humbug, Bluff and Ballyhoo" on public relations as practiced by Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud's.</p>

            <p>In the project's first stage, an interactive map was produced that represents the historical chronotope using multimedia sources. Methodologically, this digital topography attempts to assemble the events as actor-networks in the sense of Bruno Latour. Inspired by the platform HyperCities, we rectified a high-resolution scan of a city map of Vienna from 1933, provided by the Austrian National Library, to align with the underlying GIS data of OpenStreetMap. Regarding the application stack, our programmers Rory Solomon and Darius Daftary have deployed the following open source technologies: Leaflet (JavaScript mapping library), AngularJS (JavaScript framework), Django (server-side web application framework), Python (programming language), PostgreSQL database (with PostGIS extension), and Ubuntu Linux (operating system). On the map's interface, you may explore the exemplary time-space by clicking on the icons and paths that open windows with thick descriptions of the associated events, including edited images, movies, and sound files. A timeline allows you to choose specific periods within the twenty-four-hour span, and discover what was happening simultaneously at different places in the city. The icon system, created by our designer Mallory Brennan, highlights the heterogeneous networks of the events through a visual vocabulary of the human and non-human actors involved in the proceedings—planes, leaders, cars, soldiers, cameras, stages, reporters, microphones, newspapers, buildings, etc.</p>

            <p>In the project's second phase, the historical a priori of these actual media experiences will be studied: which forms of knowledge, relations of power, and modes of subjectivation pervade the events in Vienna on May 13 and 14, 1933? Following Michel Foucault, this narrative topology examines three dispositifs of mediation—firstly, sovereign signs leading from 1933 back to the heroes of 1683 and the classical age in general; secondly, disciplinary gazes capturing life in modern institutions from prisons around 1800 to interwar cinemas; and thirdly, controlled transmissions as fostered in the 20th century, emerging in the form of target groups and public relations. We are working on narrated tours of the chronotope that make use of "ontographs," which are photographs of pictures from the past in the present: the older images are oriented within the space in which they were taken years earlier and recaptured like a mise-en-abyme. Finally, the historical analysis will be the subject of a book written by Simon Ganahl, the scholarly head of the project. It is our long-term goal to develop Campus Medius into a collaborative platform for mapping experiential fields of mediality. Our methodological, technological, and representational concepts would enable scholars, programmers, and designers to explore a wide range of media experiences, which go beyond Western modernity and reveal alternative dispositifs of mediation.</p>
